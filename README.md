## Creating your first server
```javascript
var StirFry = require('stirfry');
var server  = new StirFry(8080);
server.get(/.*?\/(.*?)\/.*/, function(request, response, end) {
    response.send(request.params[0]);
    end();
});
```

That code creates a new server and sets it to listen for any request on port 8080 that has at least two slashes in it.

`request.params[0]` is the same as saying $1 in regex replace `request.params[1]` would be the same as saying $2 and so on. `response.send` appends the input to the response. `end()` stops that request from activating any other get listeners.

## Static file servers
```javascript
var StirFry = require('stirfry');
var server  = new StirFry(8080);
server.pre(StirFry.static('public'));
```
That example uses the built in `StirFry.static()` to create a static file server. The `'public'` means that the static files get served from the public folder, it is optional to leave that input. `server.pre()` is a way of saying do this before anything else. If there is no path input it automatically substitutes it with /.\*/

## Asynchronous operations
Asynchronous operations in stirfry run in parallel which means that you can't expect your asynchronous operation in one layer to show up in the same layer, so that is why I provided 3 layers
An example
```javascript
var StirFry = require('stirfry');
var fs      = require('fs');
var server  = new StirFry(8080);
server.get(function(req, res, end, async) {
	async.start();
	fs.readFile('file', function(err, data) {
		if (err) return console.log(err);
		res.send(data.toString());
		async.done();
	})
	end();
});
```
`async.start()` starts an async operation
`async.end()` ends an async operation.
The response ends only when there are 0 async operations running. once `server.process` operations are done it calls `server.pre` operations, and once those are done, it calls `server.get` operations, and once those are done it ends the response
